# Ecommerce-Site
This is a learning project where I make an Ecommerce site. 

The designs will integrate MUI. And several advanced features of React will be used such as Skeleton Loading, Lazy Loading, Connect in redux, Error Boundaries, memoization, all types of hooks, filters, useSearchParams and various other hooks. I also fetched data with axios and set an axios interceptor function on response of the data.
